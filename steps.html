        <p>
          The Flood Control Act of 1928 (FCA 1928) (70th United States Congress,
           Sess. 1. Ch. 569, enacted May 15, 1928) authorized the United States
            Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct projects for the control
             of floods on the Mississippi River and its tributaries as well as the 
             Sacramento River in California.[1] It was sponsored by Senator
              Wesley L. Jones (R) of Washington and Representative Frank R. Reid (R) of
               Illinois,[citation needed] in response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.

         FCA 1928 had three important effects. It increased public awareness of advances in flood control theory and practice. It put flood control on par with other major projects of its time with the largest public works appropriation ever authorized. And, 
         FCA 1928 increased debate on local contributions to a new level.[2]
